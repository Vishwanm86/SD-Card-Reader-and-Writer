Technical Manual for Arduino Data Logger

Introduction

This manual provides instructions for using the Arduino Data Logger, which records four voltage channels and two current channels. Data is saved to an SD card every second. The logger can also transfer files to a computer and delete files from the SD card.

Hardware Requirements

Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Mega)
SD card module
Four voltage sensors
Two current sensors
Breadboard and jumper wires
Software Requirements

Arduino IDE
SD card library
Connections

Connect the SD card module to the Arduino board according to the module's specifications.
Connect the voltage sensors to analog input pins on the Arduino board.
Connect the current sensors to appropriate input pins on the Arduino board (consult sensor datasheets for specific connections).
Uploading the Code

Open the Arduino IDE.
Load the provided code (insert code file name here).
Select the correct board and port in the IDE.
Upload the code to the Arduino board.
Operating Instructions

Logging Mode:

The logger starts in logging mode by default.
Data is saved to the SD card every second.
To stop logging, send the letter "S" through the serial monitor.
File Transfer Mode:

To enter file transfer mode, send the letter "S" through the serial monitor while in logging mode.
The logger will list available files on the SD card with their serial numbers.
To transfer a file, send the serial number of the desired file.
To delete a file, send the command "delete" followed by the serial number of the file.
To exit file transfer mode, send the letter "X".
Troubleshooting

SD card not recognized: Check connections and ensure the SD card is formatted correctly.
Data not logging: Verify sensor connections and code configuration.
File transfer errors: Check serial communication settings and SD card capacity.
Additional Notes

The specific code implementation, sensor types, and pin assignments may vary. Refer to the accompanying code for details.
Consider power requirements and battery options for long-term logging.
Implement error handling and data validation for robust operation.
Safety Precautions

Disconnect power before making any hardware changes.
Use appropriate voltage and current ranges for sensors and Arduino inputs.
Avoid short circuits and potential hazards.
